It was my first project in Explore Data Analysis of Airfare and Passengers
I have used different libraries for different models
It has different plots based on the Variables.
I have used the correlation matrix to evalute the realtion between two different variables in a data set.
Also have Multivariate and scatter plot of statistical technique used to model the relation between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variables.
To Show the graphical relation between to variables i have used scatter plot.
For Multi Linear Regression model split the data into train set and test set.
Transformations like log can improve model accuracy slightly but still effect of average MLA stays most significant
After predicting the data set,  Flight fare of market leading airline and Low Price airline seem to fall in similar range
